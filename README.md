# Galaxy-Defenders
Simple game where you shoot down asteroids and dodge bullets.

This is a game I made back in 2021 using pygame.
## Gamerules
  -If asteroid gets all the way to the bottom of screen, the game is over.
  
  -Player has 5 lives, live decreases if bullet hits you, if you get to 0, game is also over
  
  -Player has "power", power percentage increases with asteroids destroyed. There are 3 abilities player can use, each of which needs some power percentage
  
    abilities:
  
    -machinegun - rapid fire, needs 100% power
  
    -shield - makes player invincible for some amount of time, needs 70% power
    
    -homing missile - shoots bullet, that automaticcaly finds its way to asteroids, needs 35% power
## Note
For some reason game does not want to run from file explorer, but runs just fine from VScode
